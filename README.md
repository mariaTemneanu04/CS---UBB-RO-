Faculty repository

Hello!  My name is Maria, I'm a computer science student Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer-Science (RO).

This is a repository of all my Uni work (courses, homework, seminaries/laboratories work etc) up to this point. I cannot guarantee that they are 100% correct, but they might be helpful (more or less).
